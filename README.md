# DahejMeter 🤵💰😂

## The Most (Un)Fair Dowry Calculator!

Welcome to **DahejMeter**, the only place where your value in the _great Indian marriage market_ is determined based on _truly important_ things like **government jobs, acres of land, cows, buffaloes, and family "settings"** rather than silly things like education or profession. 🙃

### 🚀 Features

-   **Realistic Dowry Calculation** (_read: totally absurd and exaggerated calculations!_)
-   **Hilarious and Sarcastic Comments** tailored to your inputs
-   **Hidden Easter Eggs** (Try putting 'PhD' + 'Govt Job' or 0 land + no govt relatives)
-   **Live Updates** (Because dowry rates change faster than fuel prices!)

### 😂 Sample Comments

-   _"Beta, abhi bhi time hai!"_ – When your dahej is worth peanuts
-   _"Mubarak ho! Aapka Dahej Amazon Great Indian Sale se bhi sasta nikla."_
-   _"Try adding a government uncle for instant value boost!"_
-   _"Your acres of land make you a bigger catch than the last three IAS officers in your district combined!"_
-   _"Your snoring level of 80% means you need an extra bedroom – deduct ₹2 lakhs!"_
